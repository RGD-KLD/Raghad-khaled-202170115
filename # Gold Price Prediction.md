### Project Overview
This project aims to predict the gold price for the next day using historical data and various economic indicators. The process involves several key steps:

# 1.Data Loading and Exploration:

The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, which contains historical gold prices and relevant metrics.
Initial exploration of the data is performed to understand its structure and contents.

# 2.Data Preprocessing:
The Date column is converted to a datetime format for easier manipulation.
Rows with missing values in the Price Tomorrow column are removed to ensure the dataset is complete for modeling.

# 3.Correlation Analysis:
A correlation heatmap is created to visualize the relationships between different numeric features. This helps in identifying which features are most strongly related to the target variable (Price Tomorrow).

# 4.Feature Selection and Model Training:
Features (independent variables) and the target variable (dependent variable) are defined. Features include various price metrics, moving averages, economic indicators, and market indices.
The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training the model and 20% for testing it.
A linear regression model is trained on the training data.

# 5.Prediction and Evaluation:
The trained model is used to make predictions on the test data.
The performance of the model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²) score. MSE measures the average squared difference between actual and predicted values, while R² indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

### Detailed Steps
1.Suppress Warnings: Ignore any warnings to keep the output clean.
2.Import Libraries: Load necessary libraries for data manipulation, numerical operations, visualization, and machine learning.
3.Load Dataset: Import the dataset from a CSV file into a DataFrame.
4.Initial Exploration: Display the first few rows of the dataset to get an overview.
5.Convert Date Column: Change the Date column to a datetime format for easier manipulation.
6.Correlation Heatmap: Visualize the correlation between numeric features using a heatmap.

7.Predicting Gold Price:
emove rows with missing target values.
Define features and the target variable.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train a linear regression model on the training data.
Make predictions on the test data.
Evaluate the model’s performance using MSE and R² score.
